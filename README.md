School Project in Android Studio

This is a simple flashcard app designed to help you learn English/Polish words.
The main feature of this app is the flashcard learning system known as the "Leitner System" or "Spaced Repetition System (SRS)." 
The app stores guessed time data in a database and spaces the flashcards according to your familiarity with them, meaning you will receive the flashcards you are least familiar with. 

The cooldown for each repetition of a flashcard was reduced for presentation purposes.
